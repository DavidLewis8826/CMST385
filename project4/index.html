    <h2>Water Cool Splash</h2>
    <p class="center">
        Two-lane slide with stairs up the middle. This 15-foot slide has a fast slide down falling into a pool. Having stairs in the middle means kids can
        go multiple times without getting out. Steps up are big and close together making it easy for someone to climb and handrails are on the slide so kids
        lean toward the slide climbing up making it very safe.
        <br> <i>Size: 28 x 16 x 15 ft</i>
        <br>Full-Day Rental: $250

    <h2>Hot Drop</h2>
    <p class="center">
        18-foot drop to a pool with red hot colors. How does it get hotter than that? Steps on this slide are very closer to each other and handrails are on
        the slide making it very safe for someone to climb up. At the top of the slide, there is an extra step and handrail to use to make sure those last couple
        of steps are very safe and easy to use.

    <h2>Fire Party Drop</h2>
    <p class="center">
        This two-lane slide is an absolute blast. Starts with an 18-foot drop followed by a slide area to a pool. These steps are very close
        together and the handrails are on the slide so kids lean toward the slide so climbing up is safe. Also, the top area has an extra step and
        handrail to make it safe when going for those last couple of steps.
