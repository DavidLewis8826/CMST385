    <h3 class="question">What type of location is needed for inflatables? </h3>
    <p class="center">
        A grassy area is preferred to set up inflatable equipment. Bounce houses and slides are anchored in the ground. Please be sure the area 
        is clean of debris and animal waste. Stakes go into the ground approx. 12 inches. Be sure the setup is not on top of electrical lines or pipes.
        Ruskin Inflatables and Party Rentals will not be liable for any underground repair. Equipment can be set up on concrete. Please advise us if you 
        prefer equipment to be set up on concrete so we are prepared when we deliver.
